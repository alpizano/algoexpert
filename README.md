# Intro
I will document the questions in the algo expert course here in this readme, and will provide solutions in the source directories above.

## Easy
### `Two Number Sum`
Q: Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.

You can assume that there will be at msot one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.

### `Palindrome Check`
Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean representing whether the string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

### `Caesar Cipher Encryptor`
Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key.

Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter z shifted by one returns the letter a.
